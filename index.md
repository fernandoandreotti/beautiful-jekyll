### Bio

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the Computational Intelligence in BIomedical Monitoring (CIBIM) group at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering (IBME – University of Oxford, UK)). In 2017, I obtained doctoral title in Electrical Engineering at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at Technische Universität Dresden (Dresden, Germany). My thesis focused on signal processing for the extraction of the non-invasive fetal ECG from abdominal electrodes and assessing fetal heart-rate variability and morphology for new diagnostics in prenatal medicine. In 2011, I received my Engineer’s degree in Control and Automation Engineering from the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Belo Horizonte, Brazil). 
 
 
My research interests include (among others):

- machine learning and signal processing applied to biomedical signals
- filtering noisy data (Kalman filters, template subtraction, adaptive and blind source separation methods)
- modelling/simulation of cardiac activity
- design and implementation of clinical trials
- statistical data analysis
- evolutionary computing

### Publications

You can find an up-to-date list of my publications at [Publications](somewhere).

### Awards and Scholarships

### Student Supervision
I enjoy helping students solve signal processing problems while facing their first steps into research. All students were supervised by Prof. Hagen Malberg and Dr. Sebastian Zaunseder as well (Studienarbeit is similar to a B.Sc. thesis, while Diplomarbeit a M.Sc. thesis):
