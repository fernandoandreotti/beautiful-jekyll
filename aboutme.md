## Research
 
My research interests include:

- application of machine (deep) learning and signal processing techniques
- filtering noisy data (Kalman filters, blind source separation, etc)
- modelling/simulation of cardiac activity
- design and implementation of clinical trials
- statistical data analysis
- evolutionary computing
