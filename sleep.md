## Work in progress

My work as a Postoctoral Researcher at the University of Oxford entails the analysis of sleep in the diagnosis of sleep disorders such as REM Behaviour Disorder. For this purpose I make use of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks. The several approaches me and my collaborators used can be divided into the following steps.

### Sleep Stage Classification

### Tranfer Learning

### Diagnosis

### Visualisation/Understanding Decisions
