abstract = {Non-Invasive foetal electrocardiography (NI-FECG) represents an alternative foetal monitoring technique to traditional Doppler ultrasound approaches, that is non-invasive and has the potential to provide additional clinical information. However, despite the significant advances in the field of adult ECG signal processing over the past decades, the analysis of NI-FECG remains challenging and largely unexplored. This is mainly due to the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of the FECG compared to the maternal ECG, which overlaps in both time and frequency. This article is intended to be used by researchers as a practical guide to NI-FECG signal processing, in the context of the above issues. It reviews recent advances in NI-FECG research including: publicly available databases, NI-FECG extraction techniques for foetal heart rate evaluation and morphological analysis, NI-FECG simulators and the methodology and statistics for assessing the performance of the extraction algorithms. Reference to the most recent work is given, recent findings are highlighted in the form of intermediate summaries, references to open source code and publicly available databases are provided and promising directions for future research are motivated. In particular we emphasise the need and specifications for building a new open reference database of NI-FECG signals, and the need for new algorithms to be benchmarked on the same database, employing the same evaluation statistics. Finally we motivate the need for research in NI-FECG to address morphological analysis, since this represent one of the most promising avenues for this foetal monitoring modality.},

abstract = {Over the past decades, many studies have been published on the extraction of non-invasive foetal electrocardiogram (NI-FECG) from abdominal recordings. Most of these contributions claim to obtain excellent results in detecting foetal QRS (FQRS) complexes in terms of location. A small subset of authors have investigated the extraction of morphological features from the NI-FECG. However, due to the shortage of available public databases, the large variety of performance measures employed and the lack of open-source reference algorithms, most contributions cannot be meaningfully assessed. This article attempts to address these issues by presenting a standardised methodology for stress testing NI-FECG algorithms, including absolute data, as well as extraction and evaluation routines. To that end, a large database of realistic artificial signals was created, totaling 145.8 h of multichannel data and over one million FQRS complexes. An important characteristic of this dataset is the inclusion of several non-stationary events (e.g. foetal movements, uterine contractions and heart rate fluctuations) that are critical for evaluating extraction routines. To demonstrate our testing methodology, three classes of NI-FECG extraction algorithms were evaluated: blind source separation (BSS), template subtraction (TS) and adaptive methods (AM). Experiments were conducted to benchmark the performance of eight NI-FECG extraction algorithms on the artificial database focusing on: FQRS detection and morphological analysis (foetal QT and T/QRS ratio). The overall median FQRS detection accuracies (i.e. considering all non- stationary events) for the best performing methods in each group were 99.9{\%} for BSS, 97.9{\%} for AM and 96.0{\%} for TS. Both FQRS detections and morphological parameters were shown to heavily depend on the extraction techniques and signal-to-noise ratio. Particularly, it is shown that their evaluation in the source domain, obtained after using a BSS technique, should be avoided. Data, extraction algorithms and evaluation routines were released as part of the fecgsyn toolbox on Physionet under an GNU GPL open-source license. This contribution provides a standard framework for benchmarking and regulatory testing of NI-FECG extraction algorithms.},

In the field of camera-based photoplethysmography, blind source separation (BSS) techniques have been exten- sively applied to cope with artifacts and noise. Despite their wide usage, there is no consensus that common BSS ap- proaches contribute to an improved analysis of camera-based photoplethysmograms (cbPPG). This contribution compares previously proposed multispectral BSS techniques to a novel spatial BSS approach for heart rate extraction from cbPPG. Our analysis indicates that the application of BSS techniques not necessarily improves cbPPG's analysis but signal proper- ties like the signal-to-noise-ratio should be considered before applying BSS techniques.},

abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a well studied signal from which many clinically relevant parameters can be derived, such as heart rate. A key component in the estimation of these parameters is the accurate detection of the R peak in the QRS complex. While corruption of the ECG by movement artefact or sensor failure can result in poor delineation of the R peak, use of synchronously measured signals could allow for resolution of the R peak even scenarios with poor quality ECG recordings. Robust estimation of R peak locations from multimodal signals facilitates real time monitoring and is likely to reduce false alarms due to inaccurate derived parameters.We propose a method which fuses R peaks detected on the ECG using an energy detector with those detected on the arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveform using the length transform. A signal quality index (SQI) for the two signals is then derived. The ECG SQI is based upon the agreement between two distinct peak detectors. The ABP SQI estimates the blood pressure at various phases in the cardiac cycle and only accepts the signal as good quality if the values are physiologically plausible. Detections from these two signals were merged by selecting the R peak detections from the signal with a higher SQI. The approach presented in this paper was evaluated on datasets provided for the Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2014. The algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 95.1{\%} and positive predictive value of 89.3{\%} on an external evaluation set, and achieved a score of 91.5{\%}.The method here demonstrated excellent performance across a variety of signal morphologies collected during clinical practice. Fusion of R peaks from other signals has the potential to provide informed estimates of the R peak location in situations where the ECG is noisy or completely absent. Source code for the algorithm is made available freely online.},

abstract = {Introduction: The electrocardiogram (ECG) allows for interpretation of the electrical activity of the heart. The information which can be derived from the foetal ECG (FECG) goes beyond heart rate and heart rate variability. However morphological analysis of the FECG waveform is usually not performed in clinical practice. Methods: A Bayesian Filtering Framework based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for extracting the FECG from a single abdominal channel is described using a training database of 20, one minute maternal-foetal mix- tures and evaluated on 200, one minute mixtures. (Data was generated using the simulator, fecgsyn, used to gen- erate a subset of the signals of the Physionet Challenge 2013.) A single pass of the EKF (EKFS) was performed to cancel out the maternal ECG (MECG) in order to build an average FECG morphology. A dual EKF (EKFD, i.e. where both the MECG and FECG cycle morphology were modelled) was then applied to separate the three sources present in the signal mixture (noise, MECG and FECG). A normalised root mean square error and absolute QT error after EKFS and EKFD were calculated. Results: An SNR improvement of 1.97 dB after EKFS and 14.14 dB after EKFD on the test set were achieved. Median absolute error on QT measurement was 17.0 ms for the EKFS and 4.0 ms for the EKFD. Conclusion: This work is a proof of concept that the EKFDallows accurate beat to beat extraction of theFECG morphology from abdominal recordings.},

abstract = {Introduction: Intensive care unit patients are heavily monitored, and a number of clinically relevant parameters are routinely extracted from high resolution signals. In particular, heart rate is derived from intervals between pulses in pseudo-periodic signals such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) or arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms. However, poor signal quality and high noise levels can unfortunately lead to false localisation of these pulses (or peaks), resulting in incorrect estimates of heart rate. The goal of the 2014 Physionet/CinC Challenge was to encourage the creation of an intelligent system that fused information from different biosignals to create a robust set of peak detections. Methods: First, a set of peak detectors were evaluated on different cardiovascular signals. The detections were then fused using two different approaches: the first one was based on a calculated measures of signal quality for the ECG and ABP signals and the the second fusion technique was based on the regularity of the derived intervals between subsequent detections made on ECG, ABP, Stroke Volume and Photoplethysmogram signals. These techniques were developed using the MGH/MF database and submitted for scoring on the Challenge test-set. Conclusion: The best entries for the two approaches obtained an overall score of 87:88{\%} and 87:66{\%}, respectively, in phase III of the challenge, which provided the highest official score.},

It would be very useful to know the profile of pressure values during long time period, especially during standard daily activities. It could be used for homecare monitoring and prevention of premature death. Problem is that blood pressure is monitored mainly at discrete time intervals and use an inflatable cuff placed around the arm, which is uncomfortable for the patient. Currently, there are a few technical solutions for continuous non-invasive measurement of blood pressure. This review is focused on the description of methods for continuous blood pressure measurement including their limitations and especially is focused on the description method based on pulse transit time. This method could be the most widely used of methods for non-invasive long time monitoring of blood pressure in the future but now there are still a lot of unsolved problems.},

abstract = {Accurate foetal electrocardiogram (FECG) morphology extraction from non- invasive sensors remains an open problem. This is partly due to the paucity of available public databases. Even when gold standard information (i.e derived from the scalp electrode) is present, the collection of FECG can be problematic, particularly during stressful or clinically important events. In order to address this problem we have introduced an FECG simulator based on earlier work on foetal and adult ECG modelling. The open source foetal ECG synthetic simulator, fecgsyn, is able to generate maternal-foetal ECG mixtures with realistic amplitudes, morphology, beat-to-beat variability, heart rate changes and noise. Positional (rotation and translation-related) movements in the foetal and maternal heart due to respiration, foetal activity and uterine contractions were also added to the simulator. The simulator was used to generate some of the signals that were part of the 2013 PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge dataset and has been posted on Physionet.org (together with scripts to generate realistic scenarios) under an open source license. The toolbox enables further research in the field and provides part of a standard for industry and regulatory testing of rare pathological scenarios. Keywords:},

The GUI is directly linked to the previously introduced fecgsyn ECG model, which was used for producing a subset of data of the Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2013. fecgsyngui serves as a tool that facili- tates the use of the broad capabilities of fecgsyn. ECG mixtures can be generated with realistic beat-to- beat variability, morphology, amplitude modulation due to respiration and foetal movement. The GUI allows the user to visualise and generate a set of realistic scenarios to stress test and train separation and detection algorithms. Electrodes can be placed on the maternal abdomen using an interactive geometric representation. Simulation pa- rameters and generated signals can be exported to .mat files for further processing. Using the underlying model, noise sources, ectopic beats, and multiple foetuses can be added. A series of pathological scenarios for situations (described in the original publication) for which data collection is problem- atic in reality, are included. These can be further cus- tomised to mirror specific pathological situations.},

abstract = {Introduction: The ECG Bayesian filtering framework has been shown to be a promising method to extract the foetal electrocardiogram (FECG) from abdominal record- ings. This framework requires an estimation of the ECG morphology, which is obtained by approximating an aver- age beat with a number of Gaussian kernels. This approx- imation results in a high dimensional nonlinear optimiza- tion problem (finding ideal positions, width and height for these kernels). Methods: Proposed methodologies in the literature ini- tialize the optimization algorithm using fixed positions for the kernel functions. This contribution benchmarks al- ternative schemes for finding the Gaussian parameters, namely an approach based on the stationary wavelet trans- form and random search. The goal is minimizing the nor- malized mean squared error between the average beat and the approximated model, while increasing foetal QRS de- tection accuracy. Results: The suggested methods are able to produce im- proved morphology approximations of the averaged beat up 4.05{\%} (depending on the selected method). The pro- posed method using the stationary wavelet transform im- proves the goodness of the fit, while reducing the compu- tational load. However, no immediate improvement on the accuracy of FQRS detections was noticed. Such findings render the proposed method a promising tool. However, further research should be directed at transferring the im- proved fit to an improvement of FQRS detections.},

This study evaluates the behavior of two well-known methods (Independent Component Analysis and Template Subtraction). These techniques are often referred to in literature for extracting the FECG from the abdominal mixture. Our analysis quantifies the extraction results in terms of accuracy of foetal peak detection using the F1 measure. 1750 five-minute-long simulations considering the absence and presence of non-stationarity mixtures served as dataset for this study. In terms of the F1 measure, on average ICA (97.3 ± 0.1 {\%}) was found to outperform TS (88.1 ± 0.2 {\%}). Moreover, we have shown that the presence of non-stationarities can degrade the performance of both methods considerably, indicating a beat-by-beat adaptive approach may be preferable.},

abstract = {The fetal ECG derived from abdominal leads provides an alternative to standard means of fetal monitoring. Furthermore, it permits long-term and ambulant recordings, which expands the range diagnostic possibilities for evaluating the fetal health state. However, due to the temporal and spectral overlap of maternal and fetal signals, the usage of abdominal leads imposes the need for elaborated signal processing routines. In this work a modular combination of processing techniques is presented. Its core consists of two maternal ECG estimation techniques, namely the extended Kalman smoother (EKS) and template adaption (TA) in combination with an innovative detection algorithm. Our detection method employs principles of evolutionary computing to detect fetal peaks by considering the periodicity and morphological characteristics of the fetal signal. In a postprocessing phase, single channel detections are combined by means of kernel density estimation and heart rate correction. The described methodology was presented during the Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2013. The entry was the winner of the closed-source events with average scores for events 4/5 with 15.1/3.32 (TA) and 69.5/4.58 (EKS) on training set-A and 20.4/4.57 (TA) and 219/7.69 (EKS) on test set-B, respectively. Using our own clinical data (24 subjects each 20 min recordings) and statistical measures beyond the Challenge's scoring system, we further validated the proposed method. For our clinical data we obtained an average detection rate of 82.8{\%} (TA) and 83.4{\%} (EKS). The achieved results show that the proposed methods are able produce reliable fetal heart rate estimates from a restricted number of abdominal leads.},

abstract = {Heart diseases are the cause of many deaths during prenatal, childbirth and newborn periods. Therefore, the measurement of the fetal heart activity is of great importance in assessing the health state of the fetus. In order to evaluate the fetal state, health specialists, nowadays, mostly use the fetal heart rate (fHR) parameter. Many techniques for obtaining the fHR are available, however the reliability and exibility of these techniques is still not ideal. The fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) through abdominal electrodes appears to be a suitable solution to the problematic, which provides long-term monitoring during the prenatal and childbirth period. The dificulty of the fECG technique is the low energy of the fetal signals, which often is buried into maternal electrocardiography, electromyographic noises, between other noise sources. This presented study contemplates the implementation of a method to extract the fHR information from abdominal measurements. Hence, the robust Event-Synchronous Canceller (ESC) algorithm, based on template subtraction, is implemented. ESC's performance is accordingly tested with simulated and real data. Its capability for during long-term monitoring is proven and further analysis are discussed. The method was capable of detecting the fetal heart beats with an average accuracy of 82{\%} when simulated data for the different recording conditions were used. Extracting the fECG from abdominal signals is a recent development in the biomedical area. Moreover, it is the first work of the biomedical engineering research group at the Technische Universitaet Dresden in the subject. The result of this work should allow several other studies on the topic of the abdominal signals processing, mainly, the ones which depend on the acquisition of the fHR information.},
