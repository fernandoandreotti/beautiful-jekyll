### Short Bio

I am a PhD in Biomedical Engineering with 8 years experience in signal processing and machine learning applied to cardiac and brain signals. I currently am a Postdoc at the [CIBIM-Lab](https://cibim.eng.ox.ac.uk/) at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford. My research focuses on using state-of-the-art Deep Learning techniques for detecting cardiac arrhythmias, analysing sleep and neurological disorders.
